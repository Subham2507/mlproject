# Student Performance Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict student performance in mathematics based on various factors such as student demographics, family background, and study habits. The predictive model is built using machine learning techniques and deployed as a web application for easy access.

## Features

### Data Ingestion
Fetches student performance data from a Kaggle dataset.

### Data Transformation
Preprocesses and transforms the data for model training.

### Model Training
Trains a machine learning model to predict student scores.

### Flask Web Application
Provides a user-friendly interface for predicting student scores.

### AWS Deployment
Deploys the application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk using CodePipeline

###Acknowledgements
Kaggle for providing the student performance dataset.
Flask and AWS for enabling web application deployment.
